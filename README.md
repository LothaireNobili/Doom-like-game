This project is an old-school doom like game : seems like 3D, but doesn't have actual 3D engine. This project is currently at the prototyping phase. 

Things that will be added :
- actually different Ai for the ennemies
- more weapons
- easy way to select a map
- more powerful map structure (more types of walls, traps, etc...)
